1)

Pixel **awesomeFilter(Pixel image[][], int width, int height) {
for (int i = 0; i < width; i++) {
for (int j = 0; j < height; j++) {
[image[i][j] makeMoreAwesome];
}
}
return image;
}

a) memory access: [image[i][j] makeMoreAwesome]

b) O(^2)

c) O(n^4): the loop is running (n^2) times, so that times (n^2) is (n^4)

2) 

a) O(n^3), O(n^4), O(n^2) : O(n^4) because its the slowest (biggest) one

b) O(n)

c) O(n log n)

d) O(log n) because its a binary search of a sorted array

3)

a) tree

b) set or an array

c) tree

4) O(n)

5) O(m)

6) O(log n): any time you're constantly dividing by two (like in binary search), its a pretty good chance its O(log n)

7)
